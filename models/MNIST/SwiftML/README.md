# SwiftML
Repository with end-to-end ML example based on
[TF Swift tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/swift/tutorials/model_training_walkthrough).
In particular this example allows to run the LeNet network for the MNIST classification example.

### Build notes
Swift provides [package manager](https://swift.org/getting-started/#using-the-package-manager)
which helps to setup initial project area. To do that just create a new
directory and run within it the following command:
```
# initalize the new package (it is already done here)
swift package init --type executable
```
This will initialize the project and create Package.swift file which
you can later customize to include your set of dependencies, etc.
This is already done for this package.

You need to clone the [swift-model](https://github.com/tensorflow/swift-models.git) repository, in this case just outside the Swift4TFBenchmarks folder.
Alternatively in Package.swift you can change the dependency of this repo to the remote one.

To maintain the codebase you need to use the following commands (within
this project area):
```
# build/compile our codebase (the entire build will be located in .build area)
swift build

# run our executable
swift run swift-ml --help

# run our training for 5 epochs using 128 batch size and save model to model.tf file
swift run swift-ml LeNet -e 5 --batch-size 128

# clean-up our build
swift package clean

# create full release
swift build --configuration release

# grab new executable from release area and put it into provide path
cp .build/release/swift-ml /path
```
